#  Executive Summary:
This project explores the relationship between personal spending behavior and daily mood levels using a custom built finance dataset. Combining financial transactions with self reported emotional scores, the dataset provides a unique opportunity to analyise how moods can influence spending patterns and how spending can in fact affect moods. Using Tableau, SQL, and Python, this project demonstrates a full end to end analytical workflow, from data preparation to exploratory modelling and visual insights 

#  Key Insights:
Initial analysis revealed several emerging patterns:
### Higher mood levels
often alligning with increased discretionary spending, particularly in categories such as 'Eating Out' and 'Entertainment'

### Lower Mood Days
Shows more frequent spending on routines or essential categories such as 'Transport' and 'Groceries'

### Payment Methods
Contactless appear more common on high mood days suggesting a link between convenience and spontaneous purchases 

These findings highlight the potential for behavioural finance insights even within small personal datasets


# Tools Used:
## Python
Python was used for:
* Data cleaning and reprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Statistical summaries and correlation checks
* Visualisations using libraries such as 'pandas', 'matplotlib', and 'seaborn'
This stage ensured the data was structured correctly, validated and ready for deeper analysis

## SQL
SQL was used for:
* Filtering and aggregating spending habits and patterns
* Grouping transactions by category, payment methods and mood levels
* Identifying trends such as average spend per mood score
* Running queries to validate assumptions and uncover hidden patterns  
SQL provided a reliable foundation for structured analysis and reproducible insights

## Tableau
Tableau was used to transform the dataset into interactive dashboards, including:
* Mood vs Spending trend lines
* Category based spending heatmaps
* Payment method breakdowns
* Time series visualisations of daily behaviour 
These dashboards make the insights accesible, visually engaging and easy to interpret

# Project purpose:
This project demonstrates how combining behavioural data with financial records can reveal meaningful and useful patterns. It also showcases my ability to work across multiple analytical tools (Python, SQL, and Tableau).
